I'm building a success card for a progressive rating dialog. The dialog is used for user to rate a part of their work. It steps them through multiple questions then calculates a score based on their answers. I want to create a page that displays the calculated form, the individual section scores, and a option to see how the score was caculated and find out more about the rating system. This extra information should be hidden until the user expands it.

Please create 5 different versions of the success card. I want to gamify the experience.

here is a reference of the rating component
